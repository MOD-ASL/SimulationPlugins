Introduction
----------------------------------------
The SMORES simulator aims to model the capabilities of the SMORES modular robotics platform, allowing researchers to rapidly assess the capabilities of different hardware configurations and develop the algorithms required to exercise the powerful flexibility available to them. In addition to providing accurate dynamics modeling of a given robotic configuration, the simulator aims to model the reconfiguration and sensing capabilities of the SMORES modules.

The core physics and control of the simulator are currently being developed at Modlab at Penn using the simulation software Gazebo. The sensor add-ons that can be used to provide individual modules with specific sensing capabilities are being developed by Autonomous Systems Lab at Cornell. Both groups are cooperating on a NSF funded project.
